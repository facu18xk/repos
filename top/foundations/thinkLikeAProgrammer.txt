What really is think like a programmer
Well, a lot of people said you should think like a programmer, but what they really want to say 
We all face with problems in the every day life, and the way we aproach them is crucial.
A algorithm of a npc problem solving look like
* Do the solution don't even think about it 
* If the solution doesn't work, try another one 
But this is pretty unefficient and you waste a lot of time the way a programmer think is logical, they divide the big problem in little sub problems that are easy to solve, if he/she can't solve a little subproblem they gonna figure out because when they are solving the subproblems the mind start to connect the dots to come with a solution to the subproblem they cannot solve 
They have a framework to solve problems 
A framework for problem solving can look like.
1. Undertstand the problem. You undertsand the problem when you can explain the problem in plain english 
2. Plan, have a plan to resolve the problem don't jump in the solutino straight away. 
3. Divide, the problems into sub problems this will help you to avoid frustration, and quitting, you should have the sub problems because you planned how to solve the big problem
